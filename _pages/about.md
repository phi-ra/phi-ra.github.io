Hi and welcome to my webpage. I am a PhD student based in Montreal, where I work towards a degree in Mathematics under the supervision of [Arthur Charpentier](https://freakonometrics.github.io/). My research interests are centered on how modern Statistics can solve old problems in Actuarial Sciences and Econometrics. Specifically, I am interested how we can improve modelling at the intersection on Econometrics and Machine Learning. To do that, I like to dive into [Semi- and Nonparametric](/projects/semi_nonparametrics) modelling and Time Series. Further, I also work on the Joint Research Initiative for [Unusual Data for Insurance](https://jridata.github.io/), where I work on [Graph-Problems](/projects/graph_problems). 

Before rejoining academia I was employed as a Data Scientist where I worked mostly in [Customer Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_analytics). There, I got to both love and hate Python. For my undergraduate and graduate degrees I spent time in [Geneva (CH)](https://www.unige.ch/gsi/en/), [Bonn (DE)](https://www.bgse.uni-bonn.de/en) and [Paris (FR)](https://www.ensae.fr/en/).

In my spare time, I like to cook, visit the local fastfood joints and spend time outdoors.
